- When update or create something, always think about solutions for testing to make sure generated code working well
- MCP server must support sse
- using `mcp-remote` and `mcp-remote-client` to test mcp server and list tools before confirm that new changes working
```example
npx -p mcp-remote mcp-remote-client http://localhost:3001/mcp
```
- Must write down connect instruction when server start
- Using docs from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports to implement mcp server
- make sure we do not leak any sensitive env to files that not in .gitignore
- Always using index.js as entrypoint
- All tools must have an inputSchema property
- When testing locally, need to check if .env have needed env or not, it not need to use Authorization header to authorize request to mcp server.
- Each tools/Api should be splited into a separated file
- Each API call to n8n should have a unit test
